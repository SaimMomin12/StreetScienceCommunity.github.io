# Base-calling the MinION raw fast5 files

MinKnow is the interface software to the Minion handheld device, for configurations, sequencing initiation and transfer of the sequencing signals from the device to the computer. 

By default MinKnow generates FASTQ files (basecalled) from the fast5 files (raw signal files) in real time.  

Otherwise, after the sequencing finished, one can separately use the MinKnow integrated basecaller or another basecaller (such as Albacore) to generate fastq files from the fast5 files.

1. Install MinKnow by following the [instructions from Nanopore](https://community.nanoporetech.com/guides/minion/rapid/introduction)
2. Run it on the files generated by the MinION

Optionally MinKnow can be used to base-call the signals also in realtime using the integrated Guppy basecaller. This option is enabled by default. It might be better to skip the real time base-calling, especially if you are not sure about the amount of sequencing signals of your DNA sample or not satisfied with the hardware specifications (SSD storage capacity, memory, CPU) of your host computer.

## Base call with Albacore (optional)

Albacore is/was one of the recommended basecallers, an example of call which is tuned for our first sequencing data is:

1. Install Albacore basecaller (optional) by following the [instructions from Nanopore](https://community.nanoporetech.com/protocols/albacore-offline-basecalli/)
2. Run it using

   ```
   $ read_fast5_basecaller.py --flowcell FLO-MIN106 --kit SQK-RAD004 --output_format fast5,fastq --input fast5/ --save_path fast5-albacore/ --worker_threads 4 -r
   ```

For details, please double check the [documentation and guide in the Nanopore website](https://community.nanoporetech.com/protocols/albacore-offline-basecalli/).

# Taxonomy identification

## Using Kraken2 on Galaxy

Kraken2 is an open source softwares that is recommended for metagenomic analysis of Nanopore data. The databases for several domains are integrated and available on the [Street Science Galaxy](https://streetscience.usegalaxy.eu/)

1. Go to https://streetscience.usegalaxy.eu/
2. Create an account (if you do not have one)
1. Create a new history
1. Upload the fastq file to usegalaxy.eu
2. Search for **Kraken2** from the tools section
3. Run **Kraken2** on the fastq file with these options
   - *"Single or paired reads"*: `Single`
        - *"Input sequences"*: imported file
   - *"Print scientific names instead of just taxids"* : `Yes`
   - In *"Create Report"*
        - *"Print a report with aggregrate counts/clade to file"*: `Yes`
   - *"Select a Kraken2 database"*: `fungi`

**Kraken2** generated a tabular file as well as a report.

The report is a text file with a tree-like structure that can be downloaded and viewed in an editor. E.g.
```
39.40  1335    1335    U       0       unclassified

```


Where the column fields are:
```
1. Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
2. Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
3. Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
4. A rank code, indicating (U)nclassified, (R)oot, (D)omain, (K)ingdom,
   (P)hylum, (C)lass, (O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, or (S)pecies.
   Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is
   formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with
   a number indicating the distance from that rank.  E.g., "G2" is a
   rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the
   grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.
5. NCBI taxonomic ID number
6. Indented scientific name
```

We would like now to visualize this information using **Krona**

1. Search for **Krona pie chart** from the tools section
2. Run **Krona pie chart**
   - *"What is the type of your input data"*: `Tabular`
        - *"Input file"* \* : report from **Kraken2**

(\*) Some reformatting of the data might be needed for a proper visualization, please refer to the history.

> A Galaxy history for the kickoff sequencing data is available on [streetscience.usegalaxy.eu](https://streetscience.usegalaxy.eu/u/milad/h/nanoporebeerdecodechimaytriple)

This will generate an interactive html chart.

## Using One Codex web server

1. Register for a free academics account at [One Codex](https://app.onecodex.com/register)
2. Upload the fastq file

   The fastq is the ultimate output of sequencing that is generated by MinKnow internal basecaller or by alternative basecaller like Albacore.
   
   ![](/images/protocols/beer-data-analysis/codex1.png){: width="100%"}

3. Click on the Results buttom from the samples tab on the top left panel

   It might take a few minutes until the results are getting available.  You should see something like this:

   ![](/images/protocols/beer-data-analysis/codex2.png){: width="100%"}

Codex reports an intuitive interactive html output of the classification. The visually interesting result would be **Taxonomy Chart of Classified Reads**
