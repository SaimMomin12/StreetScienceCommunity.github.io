## Requirements

The most important: **2 bottles of beer (33cl)**. In our first prototype, we used a Chimay red. Using a non-filtered beer should give more DNA for sequencing.

Needed consumables:
1. TrisHCl-buffer (1M, pH 7.4)
	-1.0mL per sample + 50ml per sample (washing)
2. 70% EtOH (for molecular biology)
	- 1.5mL per sample
3. Isopropanol (for molecular biology)
	- 600µL per sample
4. Sterile water (for molecular biology)
	- 50µL per sample
5. Sterile eppis (1.5mL)
	- 2 per sample
6. Falcon tubes (according to beer volume)
7. Cool down centrifuge for falcon tubes
8. Switch on thermo block at 65°C



### Before starting
Prewarm DNA Releasing Reagent A and B at 37°C for 5 min 

### STEP 1: Harvest the yeast from the beer
1. Shake the beer bottle (a bit)
2. Transfer into a 1000 ml Erlenmeyer flask (the big glass that looks like a triangle)
	- You should carefully shake it to remove most of the CO2
3. Transfer the beer (not the foam) into 50 ml Falcon tubes 
4. Centrifuge 4000 rpm 10 min 4°C
5. Discard carefully the supernatant either by pouring the liquid phase. But anyway, be sure that the pellet remains in the Falcon.
6. Transfer 1 ml of TrisHCl-buffer (1M, pH 7.4) to the Falcon. Mix by pipetting to resolve the pellet (Aspirate and pull out the liquid a couple of time with the pipette. You will see that the pellet will go into solution and disappear.) Afterwards, no solid phase should be visible and the solution should turned into a brownish color.
7. Fill up to 20ml
8. Centrifuge 4000 rpm 10 min 4°C
9. Discard supernatant
10. Resuspend the cells (with ca. 1ml 1M TrisHCl buffer pH 7.4) 
11. Transfer the solution into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.
12. Weigth pellets (fresh empty 1.5ml eppi as tara): 6 eppis, weights between 30mg and 60mg 
13. Pool pellets from two eppis to achieve ca. 70-90mg pellet per eppi (final # of eppis: 3)



### STEP 2: Break-down the yeast cell wall – first round
Here: incubation times can be prolonged for difficult to lyse organisms
- Suspend cells in an appropriate amount of the Y-PER Reagent. Scale the amount of Y-PER Reagent accordingly, maintaining a ratio of 8μL/1mg pellet. 
	- We assumed all pellets correspond to 80 mg and added 640µl Y-PER
- Mix by pipetting up and down until the mixture is homogenous
- Incubate at 65°C for 10 minutes. (can be extended – SHOULD BE EXTENDED??)


### STEP 3: Break-down the yeast cell wall – second round
Here: incubation times can be prolonged for difficult to lyse organisms
- Centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 5 minutes, 
- Discard supernatant,
- Add 400μL of DNA Releasing Reagent A, 
- Add 400μL of DNA Releasing Reagent B
- Mix by pipetting up and down until the mixture is homogenous
- Incubate at 65°C for 10 minutes. (can be extended – SHOULD BE EXTENDED??)


### STEP 4: Stop protein activity in the solution
- Add 200μL of Protein Removal Reagent to mixture
- Invert several times (>20x). 
- Centrifuge at least 13,000 × g for 5 minutes 
- Transfer supernatant (only 900µl!!!!!) to a new 1.5mL centrifuge tube. 


### STEP 5: Precipitate (find a non-scientific word!) the DNA
- Add 600μL isopropyl alcohol to fill tube. 
- Mix gently by inversion. (>20x).
- Precipitate genomic DNA by centrifuging the mixture at 13,000 × g for 10 minutes.


### STEP 6: Wash the DNA to remove unwanted substances
- Remove supernatant, being careful not to discard any of the pellet, which is clear and hard to see. 
- Add 1.5mL of 70% ethanol to the pellet, invert several times (>20x). 
- Centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 1 minute to wash off any residual salts or cellular debris clinging to the DNA or tube. 
- Invert the tube to dry any residual ethanol before proceeding to Step 7. (took ca. 30-45min)

### STEP 7: Resuspend the DNA

- Resuspend in 50μL sterile water. Pellet should solubilize completely within 5 minutes (not really). Flick the bottom of the tube carefully, or pipette solution up and down. Wash the sides of the tubes until all the genomic DNA is in solution.
