The [Galaxy Community Conference](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/) will be held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July. 

The Street Science Community will participate to the event. During the first day, we will demonstrate how to extract the DNA of beer (["Beer Decoded, Here and Now!"](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/QZyL/beer-decoded-here-and-now)). On Wednesday afternoon, Teresa will give a talk about ["Street Science Community: make science tangible & accessible by bringing it to the 'street' with open science workshops"](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfv/street-science-community-make-science-tangible-accessible-by-bringing-it-to-the-street-with-open-science-workshops)
